1. What is namespace in Python?,"Answer: In Python, every name introduced has a place where resides and can be found. This space is known as anamespace. It is an address location where a variable name is mapped to the object placed. Whenever the variable issearched out, this address location will be searched, to get the corresponding object."
2. How do you make 3D plots/visualizations using NumPy/SciPy?,"Answer: Like 2D plotting, 3D graphics is beyond the scope of NumPy and SciPy, but just as in the 2D case, packages existthat integrate with NumPy. Matplotlib provides basic 3D plotting in the mplot3d subpackage, whereas Mayavi provides a widerange of high-quality 3D visualization features, utilizing the powerful VTK engine."
3. Differentiate between .py and .pyc files?,Answer: Both .py and .pyc files hold the byte code. “.pyc” is a compiled version of Python file. This file is automaticallygenerated by Python to improve performance. The .pyc file is having byte code which is platform independent and can beexecuted on any operating system that supports .pyc format.Note: there is no difference in speed when the program is read from .pyc or .py file; the only difference is the load time.
4. What are Python's dictionaries?,"Answer: Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl andconsist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on theother hand, can be any arbitrary Python object."
5. How do | send mail from a Python script?,"Answer: Use the standard library module smtplib. Here’s a very simple interactive mail sender that uses it. This method willwork on any host that supports an SMTP listener.import sys, smtplibfromaddr = raw_input(“From: “)toaddrs = raw_input(""To: “).split(,’)print “Enter message, end with *D:”msg =""while 1:line = sys.stdin.readline()if not line:breakmsg = msg + line# The actual mail sendsserver = smtplib.SMTP(‘localhost’)server.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddrs, msg)server.quit()A UNIX-only alternative uses to send mail. The location of the send mail program varies between systems; sometimes it is/usr/lib/sendmail, sometime /usr/sbin/sendmail. The send mail manual page will help you out. Here’s some sample code:SENDMAIL = “/usr/sbin/sendmail” # sendmail locationimport osp = os.popen(“%s -t -i” % SENDMAIL, “w”)p.write(“To: receiver@example.comn"")p.write(“Subject: testn”)p.write(“n’) # blank line separating headers from bodyp.write(“Some textn”)p.write(“some more textn”)sts = p.close()if sts != 0:print “Sendmail exit status”, sts"
6. Why is that none of my threads are not running? How can | make it work?,"Answer: As soon as the main thread exits, all threads are killed. Your main thread is running too quickly, giving the threads notime to do any work.A simple fix is to add a sleep to the end of the program that’s long enough for all the threads to finish:import threading, timedef thread_task(name, n):for | in range(n): print name, ifor | in range(10)"
7. Explain about ODBC and Python?,"Answer: ODBC (“Open Database Connectivity) API standard allows the connections with any database that supports theinterface, such as PostgreSQL database or Microsoft Access in a transparent manner. There are 3 ODBC modules for Python:PythonWin ODBC module - limited developmentmxODBC - commercial productpyodbe — it is an open source Python package."
8. Explain Python's pass by references Vs pass by value. (or) Explain about Python's parameter passing mechanism?,"Answer: In Python, by default, all the parameters (arguments) are passed “by reference” to the functions. Thus, if you changethe value of the parameter within a function, the change is reflected in the calling function. We can even observe the pass “byvalue” kind of behavior whenever we pass the arguments to functions that are of type say numbers, strings, tuples. This isbecause of the immutable nature of them."
9. What is a module and package in Python?,"Answer: The module is the way to structure a program. Each Python program file is a module, which imports other moduleslike objects and attributes.The folder of the Python program is a package of modules. A package can have modules or subfolders."
10. How does exception handling in Python differ from Java?,"Answer: optional clauses for a block In Python.Python has its own method of implementing exception handling. is the block which can be used by the programmer to seethe error details without having to terminate the program. Also, in some cases, this statement offers a solution to deal withthe error."
11. Control flow statements?,"Answer: By default, python program execution starts from the first line, execute each and every statement only once andtransactions the program if the last statement of the program execution is over.Control flow statements are used to disturb the normal flow of the execution of the program."
12. What is a Tuple?,"Answer:1. Tuple Objects can be created by using parenthesis or by calling tuple function or by assigning multiple values to a singlevariable2. Tuple objects are immutable objects3. Incision order is preserved4. Duplicate elements are allowed5. Heterogeneous elements are allowed6. Tuple supports both positive and negative indexing7. The elements of the tuple can be mutable or immutableExample:x=()print(x)print(type(x))print(len(x))y-tuple()print(y)print(type(y))print(len(y))z=10,20print(z)print(type(z))print(len(z))p=(10,20,30,40,50,10,20,10) Insertion & duplicateprint(p)q=(100, 123.123, True, “mindmajix”) Heterogeneousprint(q)."
13. How can you Get the Google cache age of any URL or web page?,Answer:Use the following URL format:Be sure to replace “URLGOESHERE” with the proper web address of the page or site whose cache you want to retrieve andsee the time for.
"14, What is map function in Python?","Answer: map function executes the function given as the first argument on all the elements of the iterable given as thesecond argument. If the function given takes in more than 1 arguments, then many iterables are given."
15. What is Anonymous Function or Lambda Function?,Answer:A function which doesn’t contain any name is known as an anonymous function lambda functionSyntax:lambda arguments: expressionLambda function we can assign to the variable & we can call the lambda function through the variableExample:myfunction=lambda x:x*xa=myfunction(10)print(a)Output: 100
16. Modules Search Path??,Answer: By default python interpreter search for the imported modules in the following locations:Current directory (main module location)Environment variable pathInstallation dependent directoryIf the imported module is not found in any one of the above locations. Then python interpreter gives an error.Built-in attributes of a module:By default for each and every python module some properties are added internally and we call those properties as a built-in-attribute of a module. (Interview Questions and Answers)
17. What is the function of a negative index?,"Answer: The sequences in python are indexed and it consists of the positive as well as negative numbers. The numbers thatare positive uses ‘0’ that is used as the first index and ‘1’ as the second index and the process goes on like that. The index forthe negative number starts from ‘-1’ that represents the last index in the sequence and ‘-2’ as the penultimate index and thesequence carries forward like the positive number. The negative index is used to remove any new-line spaces from the stringand allow the string to except the last character that is given as S[:-1]. The negative index is also used to show the index torepresent the string in the correct order.Write a program to check whether the object is of a class or its subclass.There is a method which is built-in to show the instances of an object that consists of many classes by providing a tuple in atable instead of individual classes. The method is given as isinstance(obj,cls) and in more details given as:isinstance(obj, (class1, class2, ...)) that is used to check about the object's presence in one of the classes. The built in typescan also have many formats of the same function like isinstance(obj, str) or isinstance(obj, (int, long, float, complex)).It is not preferred to use the class instead of user-defined classes are made that allow easy object-oriented style to define thebehavior of the object's class. These perform a different thing that is based on the class. The function differs from one classto another class.To find out the object of the particular class the following program is used:def search(obj):if isinstance(obj, box):# This is the code that is given for the box and writes the program in the objectelif isinstance(obj, Document):# This is the code that searches the document and writes the values in itelifobj.search()#This is the function used to search the object's class."
18. What is the function of “self”?,"Answer: “Self” is a variable that represents the instance of the object to itself. In most of the object-oriented programminglanguage, this is passed as to the methods as a hidden parameter that is defined by an object. But, in python, it is declared itand pass it explicitly. It is the first argument that gets created in the instance of class A and the parameters to the methodsare passed automatically. It refers to a separate instance of the variable for individual objects. This is the first argument thatis used in the class instance and the “self” method is defined explicitly to all the methods that are used and present. Thevariables are referred to as “self.xxx""."
19. What are the steps required to make a script executable on Unix?,"Answer: The steps that are required to make a script executable are to:— First, create a script file and write the code that has to be executed in it.— Make the file mode as executable by making the first line starts with #! this is the line that python interpreter reads.— Set the permission for the file by using chmod +x file. The file uses the line that is the most important line to be used:#!/usr/local/bin/python- This explains the pathname that is given to the python interpreter and it is independent of the environment programs.— The absolute pathname should be included so that the interpreter can interpret and execute the code accordingly. Thesample code that is written:#1 /bin/sh# Write your code hereexec python $0 ${1+’$@""}# Write the function that needs to be included."
20. What are the Packages??,Answer: The package is nothing but a folder or dictionary which represents a collection of modulesA package can also contain sub packagesWe can import the modules of the package by using the package name. module nameWe can import the modules of the package by using the package name. subpackage name.module name
21. What is File Handling?,"Answer: The file is a named location on the disk, which stores the data in a permanent manner.Python language provides various functions and methods to provide communication between python programs and files.Python programs can open the file, perform the read or write operations on the file and close the fileWe can open the files by calling the open function of built-in-modulesAt the time of opening the file, we have to specify the mode of the fileMode of the file indicates for what purpose the file is going to be opened(r,w, a,b)"
22. When would you use a break statement in a for loop?,"Answer: The break statement states that the function of the loop is over and to move on to the next block of code. Forexample, when the item being searched is found, there is no need to keep looping. The break statement comes into play hereand the loop terminates and the execution moves on to the next section of the code."
23. How To Save An Image Locally Using Python Whose URL Address | Already Know?,"Answer: We will use the following code to save an image locally from an URL address1.import urllib.request2.urllib.request.urlretrieve(“URL”, “local-filename.jpg”)"
24. What is the process to run sub-process with pipes that connect both input and output?,"Answer: The popen2() module is used to run the sub-process but due to some difficulty in processing like the creation ofdeadlock that keeps a process blocked that wait for the output from the child and child is waiting for the input. The deadlockoccurs due to the fact that parent and child don’t have the synchronization and both are waiting to get the processor toprovide the resources to one another. Use of popen3() method allows the reading of stdout and stderr to take place wherethe internal buffer increases and there is no read() takes place to share the resources. popen2() take care of the deadlock byproviding the methods like wait() and waitpid() that finishes a process first and when a request comes it hands over theresponsibility to the process that is waiting for the resources.The program is used to show the process and run it.import popen2fromchild, tochild = popen2.popen2(“command”)tochild.write(“inputn”)tochild.flush()output = fromchild.readline()Top 54 Python Interview Questions And Answers For Experienced"
25. What are the different ways to generate random numbers?,"Answer: The random module is the standard module that is used to generate a random number.The method is defined as:import random.random()The statement random.random() method return the floating point number that is in the range of [0, 1). The function generatesrandom float numbers. The methods that are used with the random class are the bound methods of the hidden instances.The instances of the Random can be done to show the multi-threading programs that create a different instance of individualthreads. The other random generators that are used in this are:— randrange(a, b): it chooses an integer and defines the range in-between [a, b). It returns the elements by selecting themrandomly from the range that is specified. It doesn't build a range object.— uniform(a, b): it chooses a floating point number that is defined in the range of [a,b).lyt returns the floating point number— normalvariate(mean, sdev): it is used for the normal distribution where the mu is a mean and the sdev is a sigma that isused for standard deviation.— The Random class that is used and instantiated creates an independent multiple random number generators.Write a program to show the singleton pattern used in python.Singleton patter is used to provide a mechanism that limits the number of instances that can be used by one class. It alsoallows the same object to be shared between many different parts of the code. This allows the global variables to be used asthe actual data that is used is hidden by the singleton class interface. The singleton class interface can have only one publicmember and one class method Handle. Private constructors are not used to creating an object that is used outside the class.The process waits for the static member function to create new instances and return the singleton object."
26. What Are The Built-In Types Available In Python?,Answer: Here is the list of most commonly used built-in types that Python supports:Immutable built-in types of PythonNumbersStringsTuplesMutable built-in types of PythonListDictionariesSets
27. Which methods of Python are used to determine the type of instance and inheritance?,"Answer:Python has 2 built-in functions that work with inheritance:isinstance() — this method checks the type of instance.for eg, isinstance(myObj, int) — returns True only when “myObj. class” is “int”.issubclass() — this method checks class inheritancefor eg: issubclass(bool, int) — returns True because “bool” is a subclass of “int”.issubclass(unicode, str) — returns False because “unicode” is not a subclass of “str”."
28. What is the use of enumerate() in Python?,"Answer: Using enumerate() function you can iterate through the sequence and retrieve the index position and itscorresponding value at the same time.>>> for iv in enumerate([‘Python’,Java’,C++']):print(i,v)0 Python1 Java2C++"
29. How many kinds of sequences are supported by Python? What are they?,"Answer: Python supports 7 sequence types. They are str, list, tuple, unicode, bytearray, xrange, and buffer. where xrange isdeprecated in python 3.5.X."
30. Name a few methods for matching and searching the occurrences of a pattern in a given text String?,Answer: There are 4 different methods in the “re” module to perform pattern matching. They are:match() — matches the pattern only to the beginning of the String. search() - scan the string and look for a location thepattern matches findall() — finds all the occurrences of the match and return them as a listfinder() — finds all the occurrences of match and return them as an iterator.
31. Explain how Python does Compile-time and Run-time code checking?,"Answer: Python performs some amount of compile-time checking, but most of the checks such as type, name, etc arepostponed until code execution. Consequently, if the Python code references a user -a defined function that does not exist,the code will compile successfully. In fact, the code will fail with an exception only when the code execution path referencesthe function which does not exist."
32. What is Abnormal Termination?,Answer: The concept of terminating the program in the middle of its execution without executing the last statement of themain module is known as an abnormal terminationAbnormal termination is an undesirable situation in programming languages.
33. What is Try Block?,"Answer: A block which is preceded by the try keyword is known as a try blockSyntax:try{//statements that may cause an exception}The statements which cause to run time errors and other statements which depends on the execution of run time errorsstatements are recommended to represent in a try blockWhile executing try block statement if any exception is raised then immediately try block identifies that exception, receive thatexception and forward that exception to except block without executing remaining statements to try block."
34. What is scheduling?,"Answer: Among multiple threads which thread as to start the execution first, how much time the thread as to execute afterallocated time is over, which thread, as to continue the execution next this, comes under schedulingScheduling is highly dynamic."
35. What is Threads Life Cycle?,"Answer: Threads Life CycleCreating the object of a class which is overwriting run method of thread class is known as a creating threadWhenever a thread is created then we call thread is in new state or birth state thread.Whenever we call the start method on the new state threads then those threads will be forwarded for schedulingThe threads which are forwarded for scheduling are known as ready state threadsWhenever scheduling time occurs, ready state thread starts executionThe threads which are executing are known as running state threadsWhenever sleep fun or join methods are called on the running state threads then immediately those threads will wait.The threads which are waiting are known as waiting for state threadsWhenever waiting time is over or specified thread execution is over then immediately waiting state threads are forwarded forscheduling.If running state threads execution is over then immediately those threads execution will be terminatedThe threads which execution is terminated are known as dead state threads."
36. What is Web Scraping? How do you achieve it in Python?,"Answer: Web Scrapping is a way of extracting the large amounts of information which is available on the web sites andsaving it onto the local machine or onto the database tables.In order to scrap the web: load the web page which is interesting to you. To load the web page, use the “requests” module.parse HTML from the web page to find interesting information. Python has few modules for scraping the web. They areurllib2, scrapy, pyquery, BeautifulSoap, etc."
"37. What are Accessors, mutators, @property?","Answer: Accessors and mutators are often called getters and setters in languages like “Java”. For example, if x is a propertyof a user-defined class, then the class would have methods called setX() and getX(). Python has an @property “decorator”that allows you to ad getters and setters in order to access the attribute of the class."
38. How To Find Bugs Or Perform Static Analysis In A Python Application?,"Answer: You can use PyChecker, which is a static analyzer. It identifies the bugs in Python project and also reveals the styleand complexity related bugs.Another tool is Pylint, which checks whether the Python module satisfies the coding standard."

How to retrieve data from a table in MySQL database through Python code?,"Answer:Explain.import MySQLdb module as import MySQLdbestablishes a connection to the database.db = MySQLdb.connect(“host”="" localhost”, “database-user”=""user-name”, “password”="" password”, “database-name”=""database”)initialize the cursor variable upon the established connection: c1 = db.cursor()retrieve the information by defining a required query string. s = “Select * from dept”fetch the data using fetch() methods and print it. data = c1.fetch(s)close the database connection. db.close()"
40. What Are Different Methods To Copy An Object In Python?,Answer:There are two ways to copy objects in Python.copy.copy() functionIt makes a copy of the file from source to destination.It'll return a shallow copy of the parameter.copy.deepcopy() functionIt also produces the copy of an object from the source to destination.It'll return a deep copy of the parameter that you can pass to the function.
41. When Is The Python Decorator Used?,Answer: Python decorator is a relative change that you do in Python syntax to adjust the functions quickly.
42. What Is The Key Difference Between A List And The Tuple?,"Answer:List Vs Tuple.The major difference between a list and the tuple is that the list is mutable while tuple is not. A tuple is allowed to be hashed,for example, using it as a key for dictionaries."

The common attributes of theminclude Dimensions, Colors, Fonts, Cursors, Etc.45. Name and explain the three magic methods of Python that are used in the construction and initialization of customObjects?Answer: The 3 magic methods of Python that are used in the construction and initialization of custom Objects are: init_, new,and del_.new - this method can be considered as a “constructor”. It is invoked to create an instance of a class with the statementsaid, myObj = MyClass()init_ — It is an “initializer""/ “constructor” method. It is invoked whenever any arguments are passed at the time of creating anobject. myObj = MyClass(‘Pizza’,25)del- this method is a “destructor” of the class. Whenever an object is deleted,the invocation of del__ takes place and it defines behavior during the garbage collection.Note: new, del are rarely used explicitly."
46. Which Python Function Will You Use To Convert A Number To A String?,"Answer: For converting a number into a string, you can use the built-in function <str()>. If you want an octal or hexadecimalrepresentation, use the inbuilt function <oct()> or <hex()>."
47. How Do You Debug A Program In Python? Is It Possible To Step Through Python Code?,"Answer: Yes, we can use the Python debugger () to debug any Python program. And if we start a program using, then it let useven step through the code."

49. Why And When Do You Use Generators In Python?,"Answer: A generator in Python is a function which returns an iterable object. We can iterate on the generator object using thekeyword. But we can only do that once because their values don't persist in memory, they get the values on the fly.Generators give us the ability to hold the execution of a function or a step as long as we want to keep it. However, here are afew examples where it is beneficial to use generators.We can replace loops with generators for efficiently calculating results involving large data sets.Generators are useful when we don’t want all the results and wish to hold back for some time.Instead of using a callback function, we can replace it with a generator. We can write a loop inside the function doing thesame thing as the callback and turns it into a generator."
"50. Explain split(), sub(), sub() methods of “re” module in Python?","Answer: To modify the strings, Python's “re” module is providing 3 methods. They are:split) - uses a regex pattern to “split” a given string into a list.sub() — finds all substrings where the regex pattern matches and then replace them with a different stringsubn() - it is similar to sub() and also returns the new string along with the no. of replacements"
51. How can you generate random numbers in Python?,"Answer: The random module is the standard module that is used to generate a random number. The method is defined as:1.import random2.random.randomThe statement random.random() method return the floating point number that is in the range of [0, 1). The function generatesrandom float numbers. The methods that are used with the random class are the bound methods of the hidden instances.The instances of the Random can be done to show the multi-threading programs that create a different instance of individualthreads.

52. What advantages do NumPy arrays offer over (nested) Python lists?,"Answer: Python's lists are efficient general-purpose containers. They support (fairly) efficient insertion, deletion, appending,and concatenation, and Python’s list comprehensions make them easy to construct and manipulate.They have certain limitations: they don’t support “vectorized” operations like elementwise addition and multiplication, and thefact that they can contain objects of differing types mean that Python must store type information for every element, andmust execute type dispatching code when operating on each element.NumPy is not just more efficient; it is also more convenient. You get a lot of vector and matrix operations for free, whichsometimes allow one to avoid unnecessary work. And they are also efficiently implemented.NumPy array is faster and you get a lot built-in with NumPy, FFTs, convolutions, fast searching, basic statistics, linear algebra,histograms, etc."
"53. What does this mean: *args, **kwargs? And why would we use it?","Answer: We use *args when we aren't sure how many arguments are going to be passed to a function, or if we want to pass astored list or tuple of arguments to a function. **kwargsis used when we don’t know how many keyword arguments will bepassed to a function, or it can be used to pass the values of a dictionary as keyword arguments. The identifiers args andkwargs are a convention, you could also use *bob and *billy but that would not be wise."
